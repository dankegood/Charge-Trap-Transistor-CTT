# Charge-Trap-Transistor-CTT
CTT for multi-time programmable embedded memory applications for high-k-metal-gate CMOS technologies including 14nm FinFET

The source code analyze the impact of device self-heating on the magnitude and stability of charge trapping in high-k-metal-gate nFETs and quantify device characteristics such as transconductance, gate leakage current, and threshold voltage shift.

Finally, I developed a highly accurate model to describe the charge trapping behavior in CTT for various device layouts and programming conditions. Excellent agreement with theoretical models was demonstrated and published.\
